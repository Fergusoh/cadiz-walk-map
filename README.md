🗺️ Cádiz Old Town Self-Guided Walking Tour Map
This is a single-file, interactive web application that provides a map and a walking route for a self-guided tour of the historic Old Town of Cádiz, Spain.
The app is built using vanilla HTML, CSS (via Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript, leveraging the Leaflet.js library for mapping functionality.
Features
* 19 Points of Interest (POIs): Numbered markers show the location of each stop on the tour.
* Walking Route: A polyline connecting all 19 stops in order, showing the suggested path.
* Interactive Sidebar: A list of all stops with descriptions. Clicking a list item centers the map and opens the corresponding marker's popup.
* Fully Responsive: The layout adjusts automatically for optimal viewing on both mobile phones and desktop screens.
Usage
Since this is a single, static HTML file (cadiz_walking_tour.html), you can run it in a few ways:
1. Online (GitHub Pages): Access the live, hosted version directly through the repository's GitHub Pages link.
2. Locally: Download the cadiz_walking_tour.html file and open it directly in any web browser.
Technologies Used
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript
